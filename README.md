# Development

### TECH NOTE: How we setup Deps

This lib `@gurucore/finance` use `_intersection from 'lodash/intersection'` to import function from `lodash`

- `_intersection` will not be bundled into `@gurucore/finance` by default. When you write `import \_intersection from 'lodash/intersection'`, it creates a dependency that expects `lodash` to be available at runtime.

- Specify `"peerDependencies":  {    "lodash": "^4.17.21"   }`â€‹ in `@gurucore/finance`.

  > You're using `lodash` but want to allow the consuming project to control the `lodash` version
  > It prevents multiple copies of `lodash` in the final application
  > It makes it clear to users of `@gurucore/finance` that they need to install `lodash`

- Do `tts-wallet` (which use `gurucore-finance`) need to depend on `lodash`?

  - Yes, `tts-wallet` needs to install `lodash` as a direct dependency because:
  - It's a peer dependency of `@gurucore/finance`
    The import statements in `@gurucore/finance` expect to find `lodash` in `node_modules`
  - If `tts-wallet` doesn't install `lodash`, you'll get runtime errors about missing modules

### TECH NOTE: build with Parcel

- Parcel to build https://dev.to/ihaback/create-your-own-typescript-library-with-parceljs-3dh7
- Release with [semantic-release](https://npm.im/semantic-release)
- Test with https://vitest.dev
